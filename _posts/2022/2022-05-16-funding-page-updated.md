Hello dear members,

With the massive community growth the past month I was 'forced' to upgrade our main server twice to keep up with the demand and keep things stable.

Also our media has been migrated to Wasabi S3 what will cut our media storage cut in half, almost in 3!

The new service Mastodon.Coffee has been added to the list of free services.

A big thank you to all new members on mstdn.social, all new Patrons and supporters! <3 Without your help I wouldn't have been able to do this!

Keep on tooting and have fun!

I love you all!
